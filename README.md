## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding Repo.

## The challenge

It's all about learning how to validate a form.
So, I started learning about validation using only vanilla JS.

## Future improvements:
1. Adding border to the input when there is an error.
2. Fix some bugs in the design.
3. re-creating the whole project using reactJs to learn more about Zod-Resolver.
